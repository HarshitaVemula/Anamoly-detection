# Anamoly detection using server log data

## Introduction

During my internship, I worked on detecting anamolous servers using server log data. While working on this porject I researched extensively on various anamoly detection / novelty detection techniques. While not giving away an confidential data I will summarize the methodology that I followed to detect anamolies.

## Anamoly detection in servers

Servers can behave abnormally due to many reasons:
* software failures 
* hardware (e.g., some piece of hardware simply breaks down) 
* offered load (an exceptionally high load is offered to the system)
* human errors (e.g., configuration errors).
